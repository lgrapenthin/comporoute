# comporoute

An independently composable, EDN-based routing DSL without any macro
magic.

Provides path-parameterization features and reverse routing known from
similar libs.

Allows to specify middleware for branches differently. Such middleware
has full access to dispatched path parameters.

# Influences

Most features for the route-spec DSL are heavily inspired by the
caribou/polaris project.

# Status

Unreleased alpha codebase.

Several decisions have not yet been made and minor technical
challenges have to be overcome.

This readme will be updated with a walkthrough and a license when the
project reaches a more solid state.
